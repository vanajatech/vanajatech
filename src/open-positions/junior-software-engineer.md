### Make an impact while growing as a professional

At Vanaja Tech, every member of the team matters. You will make an impact and have a part in determining the success of the company.

We are a small team - like a family - and look forward to finding people who are fun to work with but also extremely productive. The team is very dynamic and result-oriented: we do what needs to get done to make things work and customer happy.

We put your personal development, productivity and satisfaction at the center. We believe a happy employee gets more done.

As a junior software engineer, you will be given tasks to implement individual parts of systems or user interfaces.

Most of our projects are done using Javascript and node.js. Browser technologies incl. general Javascript APIs and React will be used extensively. We hope you have already worked with the aforementioned languages/technologies and can effortlessly jump in on day one.

We offer you a competitive salary and plenty of opportunities for personal growth as a professional in the industry.

The work will be done in Hämeenlinna.
