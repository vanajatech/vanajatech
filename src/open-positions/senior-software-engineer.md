### BE SIGNIFICANT - HERE YOU CAN MAKE AN IMPACT

At Vanaja Tech, every member of the team matters. You will make an impact and have a part in determining the success of the company.

We are a small team - like a family - and look forward to finding people who are fun to work with but also extremely productive. The team is very dynamic and result-oriented: we do what needs to get done to make things work and customer happy.

We put your personal development, productivity and satisfaction at the center. We believe a happy employee gets more done.

As a senior software engineer, you would be given challenging tasks in crafting whole components of systems that connect to external systems, including both UI/UX elements and/or backend code, depending on your preferences.

The first customer project of the company is in the FinTech space. The project is highly challenging, dense and meaningful. It will provide great opportunities to show your skills, work ethic and teamwork.

Most of our projects are done using Javascript and node.js. Browser technologies incl. general Javascript APIs and React will be used extensively. We hope you have already worked with the aforementioned languages/technologies and can effortlessly jump in on day one.

We offer you a competitive salary and plenty of opportunities for personal growth as a professional in the industry.

The work will be done in HÃ¤meenlinna.
